## Description
This is a classic virtual keyboard with a beautiful design. It was developed for the purpose of learning and practicing native JavaScript coding and acquainting myself with ESLint (ESLint Airbnb config was utilized).

## Features
* Switch between two color schemes using the dedicated switch located beside the input field
* Switch between two keyboard layouts â€” English and Russian - using a special key "En/Ru"
* Chosen language, color theme, Caps Lock and Shift status are automatically saved and used after refreshing the page

#### This virtual keyboard works just like a real keyboard:
* Arrows down, up, left, right implement navigation by input field
* 'Enter' moves the cursor to a new line
* 'Tab' creates a horizontal indent equal to 4 whitespace characters
* 'Backspace' deletes the character in front of the cursor;
* 'Del' deletes the character after the cursor;
* Caps Lock and Shift change the case and characters of non-functional keys
* The remaining keys display the characters in front of the cursor in the input field
